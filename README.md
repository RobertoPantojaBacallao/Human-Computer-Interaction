# Human-Computer-Interaction

This repository contains the final report for an idea of a website called Gainesville To Do. This was for a human computer interaction class.
We did not actually create the website, as the class was more about the process of creating good designs and how to collect data to improve a design.\
The report is called GainesvilleToDo_Part5.pdf and within it is a link to a high-fidelity prototype.
