# Human-Computer-Interaction

This repository contains the final report for an idea of a website called Gainesville To Do. This was for a human computer interaction class.
The class was more about the process of creating good designs and how to collect data to improve a design, but we did create the website.
The report called GainesvilleToDo_Part5.pdf has a link to a high-fidelity prototype.
The report called GainesvilleToDo_Part4-1.pdf has a link to a video of the finished website.
